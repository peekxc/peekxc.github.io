The ICP problem computationally is dominated by the first phase, a pairwise distance minimization. The 'brute-force' approach, an embarrassingly parallel problem amenable to GPU-acceleration, involves calculating the pairwise distance from every point in the query set to every point in the reference set. This however still requires linear runtime complexity per thread, rendering the trivial solution unsuitable for e.g. real-time applications. Alternative spatial indexing data structures utilizing branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) properties have been proposed as a means of reducing the algorithmic complexity of the ICP problem, however they were originally developed for serial applications: it is well known that direct conversion to their parallel equivalents often results in slower runtime performance than GPU-employed brute-force approaches due to frequent suboptimal memory access patterns and conditional computations. In this application-motivated effort, we propose a novel two-step method which exposes the intrinsic parallelism of the ICP problem, yet retains a number of the B&amp;B properties. Our solution involves an O(log n) approximate search, followed by fast vectorized search we call the Delaunay Traversal, which we show empirically finishes in O(k) time on average, where k &lt;&lt; n, and is demonstrated to generally exhibit extremely small growth factors on average. We demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the traditional B&amp;B and brute-force implementations using a variety of benchmark data sets, and demonstrate its usefulness in the context of Autonomous Aerial Refueling</summary></div></div><div class="p-2 overflow-auto px-4 py-2 space-y-1"><div class="flex items-center px-2 py-1 bg-gray-100">
