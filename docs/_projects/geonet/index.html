Partially due to the immense scale of geospatial data, current approaches to discover these macroscopic patterns are primarily driven by inherently heuristic detection methods. Although useful in practice, the inductive bias adopted by such mainstream detection schemes is often unstated or simply unknown. Inspired by recent theoretical advances in efficient non-parametric density level set estimation techniques, in this research effort we describe a semi-supervised framework for automating point of interest discovery in geospatial contexts. We outline the flexibility and utility of our approach through numerous examples, and give a systematic framework for incorporating semisupervised information while retaining finite-sample estimation guarantees.</p></div><div class="accordion-body card-body border-x-2 border-b-2 hidden"><div class="grid grid-cols-12 bg-white-100 justify-center items-center my-2 mx-2"><div class="col-span-5 px-3 overflow-hidden mx-auto"><img class="rounded-sm object-cover max-h-64" src="/resources/OSU_clustering.png"/></div><div class="col-span-7 flex flex-col px-3 overflow-y-scroll text-center"><summary class="prose-sm leading-4 text-justify max-h-64 inline">With the rapid development and widespread deployment of sensors dedicated to location-acquisition, new types of models have emerged to predict macroscopic patterns that manifest in large data sets representing &quot;significant&quot; group behavior.
