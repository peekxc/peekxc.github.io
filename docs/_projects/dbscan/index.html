It's often conjectured that the reason for the success of these methods is due to their ability of identify 'natural groups' in data. These groups are often non-convex (in terms of shape), deviating the typical premise of 'minimal variance' that underlies parametric, model-based approaches, and often appear in very large data sets. As the era of 'Big Data' continues to rise in popularity, it seems that typical notions having access to scalable, easy-to-use, and scalable implementations of these density-based methods is paramount. In this research effort, we provide fast, state-of-the-art density-based algorithms in the form of an open-source package in R. We also provide several related density-based clustering tools to help bring make state of the art density-based clustering accessible to people with large, computationally difficult problems.</p></div><div class="accordion-body card-body border-x-2 border-b-2 hidden"><div class="grid grid-cols-12 bg-white-100 justify-center items-center my-2 mx-2"><div class="col-span-5 px-3 overflow-hidden mx-auto"><img class="rounded-sm object-cover max-h-64" loading="lazy" src="/resources/hdbscan_pts.gif"/></div><div class="col-span-7 flex flex-col px-3 overflow-y-scroll text-center"><summary class="prose-sm leading-4 text-justify max-h-64 inline">Density-based clustering techniques have become extremely popular in the past decade.
