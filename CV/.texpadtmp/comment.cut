I received funding for a proposal accepted by the Google Summer of Code (GSOC) Initiative to the R Project for Statistical Computing to explore, develop, and unify developments related the theory of density-based clustering, namely theory related to the {\em cluster tree}. This involved a variety of code development which culminated in the form of an R package; for more details, see the project page.\footnotemark
