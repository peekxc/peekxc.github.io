<p>My computational experience is diverse. I used primarily C++ and ANSI-C89/C90 extensively for the the Air Force projects in my undergraduate years, occasionally mixing in calls to high level scripts written in Python or Matlab. From 2015-2019, I used the <a href=https://www.r-project.org/>R project</a> for the majority of the projects I was involved in. Since 2020, Python (+ PyBind11) has been my language of choice for development.
