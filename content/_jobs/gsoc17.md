I submitted a successful funding proposal under the Google Summer of Code (GSOC) Initiative to the R Project for Statistical Computing to explore, develop, and unify recent developments related the theory of density-based clustering. This involved a mixture of code development which culminated in the form of an R package, as well as deep research to further understand the theory and utility of the cluster tree. There was also a WSU newsroom piece that describes the proposal in a non-technical way.
