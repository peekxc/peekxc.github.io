I was hired by Dr. Steven Arnold under NASAs 10-week LERCIP program to apply
Machine Learning to a specific Material Science problem. The first phase of
the research project involving training a fairly trivial feed-forward
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to act a surrogate model for the Generalized
Method of Cells (GMC) technique. The second (non-trivial) phase of the project
involved creating a systematic procedure for interpreting various aspects of
the data produced by the surrogate model using a non-parameteric Optimal
Experimental Design (OED)-motivated optimization procedure, recently made
possible by the Approximate Coordinate Exchange algorithm.
