<h2 class="font-bold text-blue-400 text-2xl"> Programming Experience </h2>

:::{.prose-md .text-justify .leading-5}
My computational experience is diverse. My [university coursework](#education) required using Java, C++, or Matlab (10-15'). I used C++98 or ANSI-C extensively for the [AFIT](#education)-affiliated projects, occasionally writing high level scripts in Python or Matlab (+[MEX](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/cpp-mex-file-applications.html)) (13-15').
I used either the [R project](https://www.r-project.org/) (+[Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html)) or [Python](https://www.python.org/) (+[Cython](https://cython.org/)) for the majority of the projects I was involved in, preferring the former (15-19'). 
Since 2020, interfacing Python with modern C++ [FFIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface)
(e.g. [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)) has been my primary development workflow.
