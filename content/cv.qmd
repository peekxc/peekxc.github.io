:::{.card}

<article class="card">

My computational experience is diverse. Since 2015, I started using the R Project for Statistical Computing for statistical modeling, and I continue to prefer R for research. In my undergraduate years, I used both C++ (primarily C++11) and ANSI-C89/C90 extensively for a myriad of projects (see below). Part of my undergraduate research delved into project involving computational geometry which required a final implementation written in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and OpenCL. Of course, I'm proficient in both Python and Java.
