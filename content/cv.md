Programming Experience
</h2>

<div class="prose-md text-justify leading-5">

My computational experience is diverse. My [university
coursework](#education) was mostly a mix of Java, C++, and Matlab. From
2013-2015, I used C++ and ANSI-C extensively for the [Air Force
Institute](#education), occasionally writing high level scripts in
Python or Matlab. Throughout 2015-2019, I used the [R
project](https://www.r-project.org/)/[Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html)
or Python for the majority of the projects I was involved in. Since
2020, interfacing Python with modern C++
[FFIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface)
(e.g.Â [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html))
has been my preferred development workflow.
