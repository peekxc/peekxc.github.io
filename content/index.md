<div class="prose-base text-justify">

I’m a computer scientist with research interests in unsupervised
learning, algorithm design, geometric and topological data analysis, and
scientific computing. My background experience and projects can be found
on my [CV](https://mattpiekenbrock.com/cv) and [Github
profile](https://github.com/peekxc).

I’m currently a Senior Computer Scientist at
[Tenet3](https://www.tenet3.com/). I hold a PhD in C.S. from
Northeastern’s [Khoury College of Computer
Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), as well as B.S. and
M.S. degrees also in C.S. from [Wright State
University](https://www.wright.edu/).
<!-- I'm currently a PhD [transfer] student at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), Northeastern University; prior to transferring, I completed 2 years of graduate coursework from the [Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering Department](https://cmse.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University. I hold both B.S. and M.S. degrees in C.S. from [Wright State University](https://www.wright.edu/). -->

My research has been supported by various sources, including the
[NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/), [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/),
[DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/), the [Center for Survelliance
Research](https://www.wright.edu/center-for-surveillance-research/our-members),
and a [Ginther
Fellowship](https://givingto.msu.edu/stories/500k-endowment-creates-first-grad-fellowship-in-cmse),
among others.

<!-- I enjoy learning about open-ended areas of learning theory and data analysis, including topics such as unsupervised learning, clustering, dimensionality reduction, estimation theory, and so on. I'm also a [modern C++](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#abstract) enthusiast, and believer in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), and a fervent supporter of open source software.  -->
