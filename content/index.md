I’m a computer scientist with research interests in geometric and
topological data analysis, unsupervised learning, algorithm design, and
scientific computing. More information about my background and
experience can be found on my [online
CV](https://mattpiekenbrock.com/cv) and my [Github
profile](https://github.com/peekxc).

I’m currently a (transferred) PhD student at [Khoury College of Computer
Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), Northeastern University
(NEU); prior to transferring, I completed 2 years of graduate coursework
from the [Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering
Department](https://cmse.msu.edu/) (CMSE) at Michigan State University.
I hold both B.S. and M.S. degrees in C.S. from [Wright State
University](https://www.wright.edu/).

My research has been supported by various sources, including the
[NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/), [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/),
[DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/), the [Center for Survelliance
Research](https://www.wright.edu/center-for-surveillance-research/our-members),
and a [Ginther
Fellowship](https://givingto.msu.edu/stories/500k-endowment-creates-first-grad-fellowship-in-cmse),
among others.

<!-- I enjoy learning about open-ended areas of learning theory and data analysis, including topics such as unsupervised learning, clustering, dimensionality reduction, estimation theory, and so on. I'm also a [modern C++](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#abstract) enthusiast, and believer in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), and a fervent supporter of open source software.  -->
