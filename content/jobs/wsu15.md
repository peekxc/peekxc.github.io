My graduate research aimed at modeling real-world traffic network
networks at a macroscopic scale. The high-level goal of the project was
to model dynamic network representations extracted from raw
positioning/track information via random (distributional) network
models. On the software side, the project involved:

<div class="bullet_list ml-2 mt-1 lisc-desc space-y-2 prose-md"
style="list-style-type: disc !important;">

- Density-based clustering (R/Rcpp)
- Geospatial Point of Interest (POI) detection / Nonparameteric
  distribution modeling (R/C++)
- Spatio-temporal network models (R)

Research topics involved during this time include density-based
clustering algorithms, cluster validation measures, non-parametric
density estimation techniques, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
optimization techniques, and random graph modeling (stochastic block
models).
