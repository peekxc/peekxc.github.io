In 2017, I joined with a local research group as part of AFRL's Human Performance Wing to explore and expand the intersection between algorithms in TDA and machine learning. Motivated by my previous work on the foundations of density-based clustering, I focused on implementing and extending the Mapper algorithm, a popular and very general method which has been used successfully for data analysis. 

<br/>

Starting Fall 2018 I was hired full-time to assist the team in using Mapper on real-world applications. My research was centered around enabling the efficient construction of mappers in multiscale settings and on understanding the connections the Mapper algorithm had to other existing constructions, such as Reeb graphs, nerve complexes, and hierarchical clustering.
