In 2017, I joined with a local research group under [Dr. Ryan
Kramer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-kramer-8b42a35a/) as part of
[AFRL](https://www.afrl.af.mil/)’s Human Performance Wing to explore and
expand the intersection between algorithms in TDA and machine learning.
During my time there, I focused on implementing and extending the
*Mapper* algorithm, a topological method that reframes common data
analysis tasks as problems of analyzing [level
sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_set) on topological spaces. An
expository article explaining Mapper and its applications is available
[here](https://www.quantmetry.com/blog/topological-data-analysis-with-mapper/).

<br/>

I was hired full-time in Fall 2018 to assist the team in using *Mapper*
on various real-world applications, such as video segmentation, image
analysis. My research was centered around enabling the efficient
construction of mappers in multiscale settings and on understanding the
connections the Mapper algorithm had to other existing constructions,
such as [Reeb graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeb_graph), [nerve
complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_complex), and
hierarchical clustering.
