  Motivated by my previous work on the foundations of density-based clustering,
  I focused on implementing and extending the Mapper algorithm, a popular and
  very general method which has been used successfully for data analysis.

Job Description

<div class="p-2 overflow-auto px-4 py-2 bg-white-100 prose-md">

In 2017, I joined with a local research group under [Dr. Ryan
Kramer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-kramer-8b42a35a/) as part of
[AFRL](https://www.afrl.af.mil/)’s Human Performance Wing to explore and
expand the intersection between algorithms in TDA and machine learning.
My time there was focused on implementing and extending the *Mapper*
algorithm, a topological method that reframes common data analysis tasks
as problems of analyzing [level
sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_set) on topological spaces
(introduction available
[here](https://www.quantmetry.com/blog/topological-data-analysis-with-mapper/)).

<br/>

My research was centered around enabling the efficient construction of
mappers in multiscale settings and on understanding the connections the
Mapper algorithm had to other existing constructions, such as [Reeb
graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeb_graph), [nerve
complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_complex), and
hierarchical clustering. Beyond learning the theory and developing the
software, I also applied *Mapper* to various geospatial and image
analysis tasks, such as video segmentation, object recognition, and
clustering.
