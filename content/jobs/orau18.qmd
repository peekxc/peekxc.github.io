In 2017, I joined with a local research group under [Dr. Ryan Kramer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-kramer-8b42a35a/) as part of [AFRL](https://www.afrl.af.mil/)'s Human Performance Wing to explore and expand the intersection between algorithms in TDA and machine learning. My time there was focused on implementing and extending the _Mapper_ algorithm, a topological method that reframes common data analysis tasks as problems of analyzing [level sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_set) on topological spaces (introduction available [here](https://www.quantmetry.com/blog/topological-data-analysis-with-mapper/)). 

<br/>

My research was centered around enabling the efficient construction of mappers in multiscale settings and on understanding the connections the Mapper algorithm had to other existing constructions, such as [Reeb graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeb_graph), [nerve complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_complex), and hierarchical clustering. Beyond learning the theory and developing the software, I also applied _Mapper_ to various geospatial and image analysis tasks, such as video segmentation, object recognition, and clustering.
