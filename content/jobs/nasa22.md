Towards enabling delay-tolerant satellite communications in uncertain space environments, I was re-hired back at NASA as part of the Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program to expand the algorithmic theory on time-dependent routing. My research focused on incorporating additional geometric assumptions into routing models built for delay- and disruption-tolerant networks, particularly in the low Earth orbit regime.
