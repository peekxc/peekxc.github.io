I submitted a successful funding proposal under the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSOC) Initiative to the [R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/gsoc.html) to explore, develop, and unify recent developments related the theory of density-based clustering (see the [project page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/5919718795902976)). 
This involved a mixture of research and code development which culminated in the form of an [R package](https://github.com/peekxc/clustertree) for estimating *the cluster tree*, a hierarchical summary of the level-sets of a density function. There was also a [WSU newsroom piece](http://webapp2.wright.edu/web1/newsroom/2017/05/22/statistical-standout-2/) that describes the proposal in a non-technical way.
