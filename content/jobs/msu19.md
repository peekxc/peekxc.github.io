Though I began my doctoral research at Michigan State University in Fall
2019, I transferred to Northeastern University in the Fall of 2021 after
my advisor (Jose Perea) accepted a joint appointment offer to transfer
to Khoury College of Computer Sciences in Boston, MA.

<br/>

My doctoral research focused on applications of topological theory to
various common machine learning applications. In particular, much of my
time was spent on accelerating the persistence algorithm in time-varying
settings, codeveloping a topological dimensionality reduction using
fiber bundle theory, and on studying a spectral-relaxations of the
persistent rank invariant.
