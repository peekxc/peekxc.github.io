After beginning my doctoral research at Michigan State University (Fall 19'), I transferred to Northeastern University (Boston, MA) in Fall 2021 after my advisor ([Jose Perea](https://www.joperea.com/)) accepted a joint appointment offer at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences in . 

<br/> 

My doctoral research focused on applications of topological theory to various common machine learning applications. In particular, much of my time was spent on accelerating the persistence algorithm in time-varying settings, codeveloping a topological dimensionality reduction using fiber bundle theory, and on studying a spectral-relaxations of the persistent rank invariant.
