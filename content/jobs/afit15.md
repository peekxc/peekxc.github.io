Towards the end of my undergraduate degree, my contract at the [Air
Force Institute of Technology](https://www.afit.edu/) (AFIT) was
extended under ORISE, where I continued working with the LOREnet group
under [Dr. Andrew
Terzuoli](https://www.afit.edu/BIOS/bio.cfm?facID=224). During this time
I primarily worked with [Dr. Scott
Nykl](https://www.afit.edu/BIOS/bio.cfm?facID=268) on the development of
a novel Iterative Closest Point algorithm amenable to massive
parallelization, implemented in C++/CUDA, for the purposes of enabling
real-time tracking of aircraft in the context of [Autonomous Aerial
Refueling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_aerial_refueling).
