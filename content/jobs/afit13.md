I was hired at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) as an undergraduate student to do research in a multi-disciplinary team called the Low Orbitals Radar and Electromagnetism group, where I worked on a diverse set of projects involving computational, statistical, or physics-based requirements. Being my first research-oriented experience, I either assisted graduate students with primarily programmatic or educational tasks or worked on very computationally-oriented tasks.

Example projects:
  - Implementing an unsplittable flow approximation algorithm (C++ and Python)
  - Creating a conversion tool between Oracle's Abstract Data Type and XMLType (Java)
  - Developing a prototype UI to enhance searching and viewing of 2-or-3D models (JavaScript)
