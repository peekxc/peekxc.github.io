Under the guidance of [Dr. Andrew
Terzuoli](https://www.afit.edu/BIOS/bio.cfm?facID=224), I was hired at
the [Air Force Institute of Technology](https://www.afit.edu/) (AFIT) to
do research in a multi-disciplinary team called the Low Orbitals Radar
and Electromagnetism (LOREnet) group, where I worked on a diverse set of
projects involving computational, statistical, or physics-based
requirements. As my first research-oriented experience, I primarily
assisted graduate students with programmatic or
computationally-intensive tasks.
