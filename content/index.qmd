I'm a computer scientist with research interests in geometric and topological data analysis, unsupervised learning, algorithm design, and scientific computing. My background can be found on my [online CV](https://mattpiekenbrock.com/cv) and most my software projects are listed on my [Github](https://github.com/peekxc).  

I'm currently a PhD student at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), Northeastern University (NEU). 
I hold both B.S. and M.S. degrees in C.S. from [Wright State University](https://www.wright.edu/). Prior to transferring to NEU, I completed 2 years of graduate coursework in [Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering Department](https://cmse.msu.edu/) (CMSE) at Michigan State University.

My research has been supported by various sources, including the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/), [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/), the [Center for Survelliance Research](https://www.wright.edu/center-for-surveillance-research/our-members), and a [Ginther Fellowship](https://givingto.msu.edu/stories/500k-endowment-creates-first-grad-fellowship-in-cmse), among others.

<!-- I enjoy learning about open-ended areas of learning theory and data analysis, including topics such as unsupervised learning, clustering, dimensionality reduction, estimation theory, and so on. I'm also a [modern C++](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#abstract) enthusiast, and believer in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), and a fervent supporter of open source software.  -->
