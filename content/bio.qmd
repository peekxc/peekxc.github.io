:::{#hero-heading}

I'm a computer scientist with broad interests in geometric and topological data analysis, unsupervised learning, algorithm design, and scientific computing. My background and research interests can be found on my [online CV](https://mattpiekenbrock.com/cv) and my software projects are primarily listed on my [github](https://github.com/peekxc).  

<!-- I'm currently a graduate student pursuing a PhD in [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University (NEU). 
I hold both B.S. and M.S. degrees in C.S. from [Wright State University](https://www.wright.edu/).

I also completed 2 years of graduate coursework in [Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering Department](https://cmse.msu.edu/) (CMSE) at Michigan State University, prior to transferring to NEU.  -->



My research has been supported by DARPA, NSF, NASA, the Center for Survelliance Research, and 

<!-- I enjoy learning about open-ended areas of learning theory and data analysis, including topics such as unsupervised learning, clustering, dimensionality reduction, estimation theory, and so on. I'm also a [modern C++](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#abstract) enthusiast, and believer in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), and a fervent supporter of open source software.  -->
