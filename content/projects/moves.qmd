abstract: "Persistence diagrams are known to vary continuously with respect to their input, motivating the  study of their computation for time-varying filtered complexes. Computationally, simulating persistence dynamically can be reduced to maintaining a valid decomposition under adjacent transpositions in the filtration order. 
Since there are quadratically many such transpositions, this maintenance procedure exhibits limited scalability and often is too fine for many applications. 
We propose a coarser strategy for maintaining the decomposition over a 1-parameter family of filtrations that requires only subquadratic time and linear space to construct."
abstract_full: "Matrix reduction is the standard procedure for computing the persistent homology of a filtered simplicial complex with $m$ simplices. Its output is a particular decomposition of the total boundary matrix, from which the persistence diagrams and generating cycles are derived. 
	Persistence diagrams are known to vary continuously with respect to their input, motivating the  study of their computation for time-varying filtered complexes. Computationally, simulating persistence dynamically can be reduced to maintaining a valid decomposition under adjacent transpositions in the filtration order. 
	Since there are quadratically such transpositions, this maintenance procedure exhibits limited scalability and often is too fine for many applications. 
We propose a coarser strategy for maintaining the decomposition over a 1-parameter family of filtrations that requires only superlinear time and linear space to construct. 
By reduction to a particular longest common subsequence problem, we show the storage needed to employ this strategy is actually sublinear in expectation. 
Exploiting this connection, we show experimentally that the decrease in operations to compute diagrams across a family of filtrations, is proportional to the difference between the expected quadratic number of states and the proposed sublinear coarsening.
Applications to video data, dynamic metric space data, and multi-parameter persistence are also presented."
