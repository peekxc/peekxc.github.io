  shape classification are also presented.

  Using the fact that the persistent rank invariant determines the persistence
  diagram and vice versa, we introduce a framework for constructing families of
  continuous relaxations of the persistent rank invariant for persistence
  modules indexed over the real line. Like the rank invariant, these families
  obey inclusion-exclusion, are derived from simplicial boundary operators, and
  encode all the information needed to construct a persistence diagram. Unlike
  the rank invariant, these spectrally-derived families enjoy a number of
  stability and continuity properties typically reserved for persistence
  diagrams, such as smoothness and differentiability over the positive
  semi-definite cone. By leveraging its relationship with combinatorial
  Laplacian operators, we find the non-harmonic spectra of our proposed
  relaxation encode valuable geometric information about the underlying space,
  prompting several avenues for geometric data analysis. As these Laplacian
  operators are trace-class operators, we also find the corresponding relaxation
  can be efficiently approximated with a randomized algorithm based on the
  stochastic Lanczos quadrature method. We investigate the utility of our
  relaxation with applications in topological data analysis and machine
  learning, such as parameter optimization and shape classification.
