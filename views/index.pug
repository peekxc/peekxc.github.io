							p.
								I'm a graduate Research Assistant (GRA) majoring in Computer Science, with a focus (and minor) in Statistics and Statistical Modeling.
								I'm interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Specifically, I'm primarily interested in theory and practical applications of
								unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques, and their intrinsic relationships to the theory of statistical learning. This includes, for example, Clustering, Manifold Learning, Topology and Topological Data Analysis,
								Density Estimation, Reinforcement Learning (such as Generative Adversarial learning!), etc. I have supplemental research interests in the fields of
								Statistical Learning Theory, Network Science, Bayesian Statistics, Computational Geometry, and Parallel Computing.
							p.
								I previously worked part time doing research at the #[a(href="https://www.afit.edu/") Air Force Institute of Technology]
								in the Low Orbitals Radar and Electromagnetism research group (starting 2013) doing either 1) research for
								an independent project the group received under supervision of #[a(href="https://www.afit.edu/BIOS/bio.cfm?facID=224") Dr. Andrew Terzuoli]
								or 2) supporting the graduate students' research efforts in the group. I worked with the group until Spring 2017.
							p.
								In 2015, I started working for the #[a(href="http://knoesis.org/people/derek/wacs/") Web and Complex Systems Lab]
								as an undergraduate research assistant shortly after being introduced to Data Science in an elective class I took,
								CS 3250: Computational Tools and Techniques for Data Analysis taught by #[a(href="http://knoesis.org/people/derek/") Derek Doran].
								I received a graduate research assistant position in the same lab shortly after, beginning my graduate degree working towards
								a M.S. in Computer Science.
							p.
								I'm interested in the broad field of Data Science and Statistical Learning, and I've spent time learning about
								many different aspects and techniques of both fields. In short, I've spent anywhere from a few weeks to multiple months studying:
								Bayesian Networks, Neural Networks, Nonparametric density estimation, Clustering techniques, Social Network Models, Information Theory,
								Bayesian inference techniques, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The specific research I've done, along with several of the
								(either class or personal) projects and presentations I've given, are listed down further below.
							p.
								The majority of the programming I've done in my life has been with #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B") C++]
								(primarily C++11), although in recent years I've been using the
								#[a(href="https://www.r-project.org/") R Project for Statistical Computing]
								as my primary language for most tasks. I've delved into using plain #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C") ANSI-C89/C90]
								in a couple of the projects (listed below). I spent about two years doing quite a bit of scientific computing with the
								#[a(href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit") Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)]
								and subsequent dabbling with
								#[a(href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/") OpenCL], of which the former efforts lead into a few publications.
								I'm moderately proficient with #[a(href="https://www.java.com/en/") Java], and I've had a number of class-or-personal projects
								requiring the use of other languages, including #[a(href="https://www.python.org/") Python].

											h5
												| With the rapid development and widespread deployment of information in the form of "Big-Data",
												| a common exercise in many contexts is the identification of movement, which has enabled the
												| emergence of macroscopic patterns to manifest in very large data sets representing
												| "significant" group behavior. Amongst these data sets, geospatial data in particular has entered
												| into the mainstream of spatial analysis. Despite this popularity, current methods of discovering
												| POIs for the purposes of knowledge discovery--for example, improving Location-Based Service (LBS) applications--vary
												| significantly in the approach taken. Perhaps due to the unsupervised nature of the problem, although many of these
												| state-of-the-art approaches yield useful results, they are largely heuristic in nature, resulting in the inductive
												| bias inherently adopted by the model often unstated or simply unknown. In this research effort,
												| I outline a framework for automated point of interest discovery that not only allows for rigorous
												| adaptation to different types of inductive bias, but is based on recent state of the art advances in
												| finite-sample, non parametric density estimation research.

											h6
												| Density-based clustering techniques have become extremely popular in the past decade. This is
												| primarily due to the need for algorithms capable of identifying "natural groups" in data; that is,
												| groups that cannot effectively be captured using a parametric, model-based approach. There are many
												| situations where data are constrained to manifest in arbitrarily shapes due to environmental
												| influences not accounted for in the model. These "natural groups" often exhibit non-convex
												| shapes that, in the context of human supervision, can be easily and unanimously distinguished.
												| As the era of "Big Data" continues to rise in popularity, having access to scalable, easy-to-use,
												| and #[i correct] implementations of these density-based methods is paramount. In this research
												| effort, I contributed fast, scalable, and correct density-based algorithms to a very popular open-source package in R
												| using Rcpp, helping to bring make some of the most popular density-based clustering accessible
												| to people with large, computationally difficult problems.

											h6
												| The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) problem is now a well-studied problem. In the simple k=1 version, given a or set of points
												| sometimes called the query set),
												| the goal is to find the point in a given set (sometimes called the reference set) that is closest. When the query and reference sets are disjoint,
												| a naïve approach may be to simply calculate the pairwise distance from every point in the query set to every point in the reference set,
												| resulting in quadratic runtime complexity. This approach is known as the "brute-force approach."
												| Several advanced spatial indexing data structures utilizing various branch-and-bound (B&B) properties
												| have been proposed as a means of reducing the algorithmic complexity of the kNN problem. While these
												| structures are certainly useful, many were primarily developed for serial applications. It
												| is well known that direct conversion of these spatial indexing structures to their parallel equivalents
												| can often result in #[i slower] runtime performance than the naïve brute-force approaches, generally
												| due to the suboptimal memory access patterns
												| and conditional computations these spatial indexing structures often produce. In a recent application-motivated effort,
												| we propose a novel two-step method for exposing the intrinsic parallelism of the kNN problem. We demonstrate the
												| superiority of our method compared to the traditional B&B and brute-force implementations using
												| a variety of different data sets. We also show the usefulness of our method in the context of
												| Automated Aerial Refueling by improving the runtime of the well known Iterative Closest Point algorithm.
