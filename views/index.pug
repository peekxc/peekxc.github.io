						h4 Summary
						hr
						p.
							I'm a graduate Research Assistant (GRA) majoring in Computer Science, with a focus (and minor) in Statistics and Statistical Modeling.
							I'm interested in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). My research interests are in statistical learning theory,
							unsupervised learning, and building software for the purpose of scientific computing and reproducible research.
							Topics that interest me include Clustering, Manifold Learning, Topology Theory and Topological Data Analysis,
							approaches to Density Estimation, Reinforcement Learning (such as Generative Adversarial learning!), etc.
							I have supplemental research interests in the fields of Network Science, Bayesian Statistics, Computational Geometry,
							Computational Geometry, and Parallel Computing.
						p.
							I previously worked part time doing research at the #[a(href="https://www.afit.edu/") Air Force Institute of Technology]
							in the Low Orbitals Radar and Electromagnetism research group (starting 2013) doing either 1) research for
							an independent project the group received under supervision of #[a(href="https://www.afit.edu/BIOS/bio.cfm?facID=224") Dr. Andrew Terzuoli]
							or 2) supporting the graduate students' research efforts in the group. I worked with the group until early 2017.
						p.
							In 2015, I started working for the #[a(href="http://knoesis.org/people/derek/wacs/") Web and Complex Systems Lab]
							as an undergraduate research assistant shortly after being introduced to Data Science in an elective class I took,
							CS 3250: Computational Tools and Techniques for Data Analysis taught by #[a(href="http://knoesis.org/people/derek/") Derek Doran].
							I received a graduate research assistant position in the same lab shortly after, beginning my graduate degree working towards
							a M.S. in Computer Science.
						p.
							I'm interested in the intersection between Machine Learning and Statistical Learning Theory. Broadly, the topics I've studied include:
							Bayesian Networks, Unsupervised types Deep Learning (e.g. SOMs and GANs), Nonparametric density estimation, Clustering techniques, Social Network Models, Information Theory,
							Bayesian inference techniques, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The specific research I've done, along with several of the
							(either class or personal) projects and presentations I've given, are detailed further down below.
						p.
							My computational experience varies with what I'm doing. I use the #[a(href="https://www.r-project.org/") R Project for Statistical Computing]
							for nearly everything I do in ML. In my undergraduate years, I extensively used #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B") C++] (primarily C++11),
							for scientific computing projects, a few of which are listed below. Some of the projects actually required using regular
							#[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C") ANSI-C89/C90]. I spent about two years doing research into computational geometry
							and parallel computing with the
							#[a(href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit") Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)]
							and subsequent ports using
							#[a(href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/") OpenCL]. These efforts lead to a #[a(href="#ORAU") few publications].
							I'm moderately proficient with #[a(href="https://www.java.com/en/") Java], and I've had a number of class-or-personal projects
							requiring the use of other languages, i.e. #[a(href="https://www.python.org/") Python] and others.

											| With the rapid development and widespread deployment of information in the form of "Big-Data",
											| a common exercise in many contexts is the identification of movement, which has enabled the
											| emergence of macroscopic patterns to manifest in very large data sets representing
											| "significant" group behavior. Amongst these data sets, geospatial data in particular has entered
											| into the mainstream of spatial analysis. Despite this increased popularity, current methods of discovering--or even
											| defining--what these macroscopic patterns are or why they are important vary
											| significantly in the approach taken. Furthermore, although many of these state-of-the-art approaches yield useful application-oriented results,
											| they are largely heuristic in nature, resulting in the inductive bias inherently adopted by the model unstated or simply unknown.
											| In this research effort,
											| I describe a semi-supervised framework for automated point of interest discovery that not only allows for
											| adaptation to different types of inductive bias, but is based on recent state of the art advances in
											| finite-sample, non-parametric density estimation techniques.

											| Density-based clustering techniques have become extremely popular in the past decade. It's often conjectured that the
											| reason for the success of these methods is due to their ability of identify "natural groups" in data. These groups
											| are often non-convex (in terms of shape), deviating the typical premise of 'minimal variance' that underlies
											| parametric, model-based approaches, and often appear in very large data sets. As the era of "Big Data" continues to rise in popularity, it seems that typical notions
											| having access to scalable, easy-to-use,
											| and #[i correct] implementations of these density-based methods is paramount. In this research
											| effort, I contributed fast, scalable, and correct density-based algorithms to a very popular open-source package in R
											| using Rcpp, helping to bring make some of the most popular density-based clustering accessible
											| to people with large, computationally difficult problems.
										//h3.media-heading Bridging the gap between Density-Based and Model-based Clustering
										//h6
										//	| Density-based clustering techniques have become particularly popular in the past decade. This is
										//	| primarily due to the need for algorithms capable of identifying "natural groups" in data; that is,
										//	| groups that cannot effectively be captured using a parametric, model-based approach. There are many
										//	| situations where data are constrained to be observed in arbitrarily shapes due to environmental
										//	| influences. This creates "natural groups" often exhibit non-convex, arbitrarily shaped forms that in the context
										//	| of human supervision, can be easily and unanimously distinguished. Despite the effectiveness of
										//	| density-based approaches, many are inherently heuristic by design, preventing the capability of
										//	| formal statistical inference. A new density-based algorithm has been recently proposed that
										//	| may be the first to offer a statistically sound, nonparametric approach to identifying these groups.

											| The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) problem is now a well-studied problem. In the simple k=1 version, given a set of points
											| (sometimes called the query set), the goal is to find the point in a given set (sometimes called the reference set) that is closest.
											| When the query and reference sets are disjoint,
											| the naïve "brute-force approach" approach would be to simply calculate the pairwise distance from every point in the query set to every point in the reference set,
											| resulting in quadratic runtime complexity.
											| Several advanced spatial indexing data structures utilizing various branch-and-bound (B&B) properties
											| have been proposed as a means of reducing the algorithmic complexity of the kNN problem. While these
											| structures are certainly useful, many were primarily developed for serial applications. It
											| is well known that direct conversion of these spatial indexing structures to their parallel equivalents
											| can often result in #[i slower] runtime performance than naïve brute-force approaches, generally
											| due to the suboptimal memory access patterns
											| and conditional computations these spatial indexing structures often produce. In an application-motivated effort,
											| we propose a novel two-step method which exposes the intrinsic parallelism of the kNN problem. Our solution involves an O(log n) approximate search,
											| followed by fast vectorized search we call the Delaunay Traversal, which we show empirically finishes in O(k) time on average, where k << n.
											| We demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the traditional B&B and brute-force implementations using
											| a variety of heterogeneous, benchmark data sets. We also show the usefulness of our method in the context of
											| Automated Aerial Refueling by improving the runtime of the well known Iterative Closest Point algorithm.
