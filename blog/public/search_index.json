The major differences are:\n\n1. You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```` ```{r} ````);\n2. A plain Markdown post is rendered through [Blackfriday](https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/), and an R Markdown document is compiled by [**rmarkdown**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org).\n\nThere are many differences in …\n\n- [x] Write an R package.\n- [ ] Write a book.\n- [ ] ...\n- [ ] Profit!\n\nSimilarly, Blackfriday does not support LaTeX math and Pandoc does. I have added the MathJax support to this theme ([hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme)) but there is a caveat for plain Markdown posts: you have to include math expressions in a pair of backticks (inline: `` `$ $` ``; display style: `` `$$ $$` ``), e.g., `$S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$`.^[This is because we have to protect the math expressions from being interpreted as Markdown. You may not need the backticks if your math expression does not contain any special Markdown syntax such as underscores or asterisks, but it is always a safer choice to use backticks. When you happen to have a pair of literal dollar signs inside the same element, you can escape one dollar sign, e.g., `\\$50 and $100` renders \"\\$50 and $100\".] For R Markdown posts, you do not need the backticks, because Pandoc can identify and process math expressions.\n\nWhen creating a new post, you have to decide whether the post format is Markdown or R Markdown, and this can be done via the `ext` argument of the function `blogdown::new_post()`, e.g.\n\n```r\nblogdown::new_post(\"Post Title\", ext = '.Rmd')\n```\n","content":"This is a post written in plain Markdown md instead of R Markdown Rmd The major differences are 1 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document whereas in an R Markdown document you can embed R code chunks r 2 A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfridayhttpsgohugoiooverviewconfiguration and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdownhttprmarkdownrstudiocom and Pandochttppandocorg There are many differences in syntax between Blackfridays Markdown and Pandocs Markdown For example you can write a task list with Blackfriday but not with Pandoc x Write an R package Write a book Profit Similarly Blackfriday does not support LaTeX math and Pandoc does I have added the MathJax support to this theme hugolithiumthemehttpsgithubcomyihuihugolithiumtheme but there is a caveat for plain Markdown posts you have to include math expressions in a pair of backticks inline display style eg Sn sumi1n XiThis is because we have to protect the math expressions from being interpreted as Markdown You may not need the backticks if your math expression does not contain any special Markdown syntax such as underscores or asterisks but it is always a safer choice to use backticks When you happen to have a pair of literal dollar signs inside the same element you can escape one dollar sign eg 50 and 100 renders 50 and 100 For R Markdown posts you do not need the backticks because Pandoc can identify and process math expressions When creating a new post you have to decide whether the post format is Markdown or R Markdown and this can be done via the ext argument of the function blogdownnewpost eg r blogdownnewpostPost Title ext Rmd ","categories":"markdown","tags":["test","test_tag2"]},{"title":"Lorem Ipsum","date":"2017-01-01","href":"lorem-ipsum-ex","summary":"\n\n**Lorem ipsum** dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore _magna aliqua_.
