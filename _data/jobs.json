    "abstract": "As I read more into theoretical foundations of density-based clustering, my research began to intersect Topology Theory and Manifold Learning. In 2017, I began to research these connections in a minor capacity with a local research group studying the intersection of TDA and machine learning. The research primarily involved understanding the basic foundations of Topology towards extending the Mapper framework, a popular and very general method which has been used successfully for data analysis. \n \n Starting Fall 2018 I was hired full-time to begin enhancing/extending Mapper, and to assist the team in using Mapper on real-world applications. My primary research towards this end has been two-fold: (1) to enable efficient construction of mappers in a multiscale setting, (2) understand the full range of use-cases for the Mapper framework. For more details, see below.",

    "abstract": "I was hired by Dr. Steven Arnold under NASAs 10-week LERCIP program to apply Machine Learning to a specific Material Science problem. The first phase of the research project involving training a fairly trivial feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to act a surrogate model for the Generalized Method of Cells (GMC) technique. The second (non-trivial) phase of the project involved creating a systematic procedure for interpreting various aspects of the data produced by the surrogate model using a non-parameteric Optimal Experimental Design (OED)-motivated optimization procedure, recently made possible by the Approximate Coordinate Exchange algorithm.",

This involved a mixture of code development which culminated in the form of an R package, as well as deep research to further understand the theory and utility of the cluster tree. There was also a WSU newsroom piece that describes the proposal in a non-technical way.",
