  //-         As I read more into theoretical foundations of density-based clustering, my research began to intersect Topology Theory and Manifold Learning.
  //-         In 2017, I began to research these connections in a minor capacity with a local research group studying the intersection of TDA and machine learning.
  //-         The research primarily involved understanding the basic foundations of Topology towards extending the Mapper framework, a popular and very general method which has
  //-         been used successfully for data analysis.
  //-       p.
  //-         Starting Fall 2018 I was hired full-time to begin enhancing/extending Mapper, and to assist the team in using Mapper on real-world applications. My
  //-         primary research towards this end has been two-fold: (1) to enable efficient construction of mappers in a multiscale setting, (2) understand
  //-         the full range of use-cases for the Mapper framework. For more details, see below.
