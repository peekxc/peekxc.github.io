## Compiling 

Online CV: 
> pug online_CV/views/index.pug --out .

Blog (on a [separate repo](https://github.com/peekxc/blog))
> eleventy .

Website: 

Unclear. Either use quarto fully, or use render as pre-processing with quarto and then render + serve with eleventy. 

Ideally should incorporate tailwind, pug, bootstrap, and maybe even minimizers...

Probably try to figure out how to use quarto to render, then eleventy to collect + serve
